Although there&#39;s a lot to explore in this dataset like what factors impact student performance. Main focus was to see the differences between Urban and Rural areas but more from the parents&#39; perspective. . here&#39;s data dictionary: . sex - student&#39;s sex (binary: &quot;F&quot; - female or &quot;M&quot; - male) | age - student&#39;s age (numeric: from 15 to 22) | address - student&#39;s home address type (binary: &quot;U&quot; - urban or &quot;R&quot; - rural) | famsize - family size (binary: &quot;LE3&quot; - less or equal to 3 or &quot;GT3&quot; - greater than 3) | Pstatus - parent&#39;s cohabitation status (binary: &quot;T&quot; - living together or &quot;A&quot; - apart) | Medu - mother&#39;s education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 – 5th to 9th grade, 3 – secondary education or 4 – higher education) | Fedu - father&#39;s education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 – 5th to 9th grade, 3 – secondary education or 4 – higher education) | Mjob - mother&#39;s job (nominal: &quot;teacher&quot;, &quot;health&quot; care related, civil &quot;services&quot; (e.g. administrative or police), &quot;at_home&quot; or &quot;other&quot;) | Fjob - father&#39;s job (nominal: &quot;teacher&quot;, &quot;health&quot; care related, civil &quot;services&quot; (e.g. administrative or police), &quot;at_home&quot; or &quot;other&quot;) | reason - reason to choose this school (nominal: close to &quot;home&quot;, school &quot;reputation&quot;, &quot;course&quot; preference or &quot;other&quot;) | traveltime - home to school travel time (numeric: 1 - &lt;15 min., 2 - 15 to 30 min., 3 - 30 min. to 1 hour, or 4 - &gt;1 hour) | studytime - weekly study time (numeric: 1 - &lt;2 hours, 2 - 2 to 5 hours, 3 - 5 to 10 hours, or 4 - &gt;10 hours) | famrel - quality of family relationships (numeric: from 1 - very bad to 5 - excellent) | G1 - first period grade (numeric: from 0 to 20) | G2 - second period grade (numeric: from 0 to 20) | G3 - final grade (numeric: from 0 to 20, output target) | . After doing a quick value_counts() it&#39;s clear that the samples for Urban area and Rural area do not have the same ratio. Urban being about x2.5 bigger. That may skew the sample representation. I will normalize the data if necessary to avoid that. . df[&#39;address&#39;].value_counts() . U 307 R 88 Name: address, dtype: int64 . Feature Engineering .

In this table we can see students&#39; average score of single and not single from Urban and Rural areas. It seems like students of single parents from Rural areas have better scores on average compared with Urban counterparts. But students whose parents live together in Urban area have better scores. . Visualization . fig,ax=plt.subplots(figsize=(16, 9)) ax.set_title(&quot;Student&#39;s score according to where they live&quot;, fontsize=18) ax.set_xlabel(&quot;Parents&quot;) ax.set_ylabel(&quot;avg student score&quot;) sns.barplot(data=stu) plt.show() . This bar plot illustrates that students of a single parent from Rural area have better average score than other categories. . Hypothesis Test . Null Hypothesis is that the average score of students who live in Urban and Rural areas are the same. . Alternative Hypothesis is that the average scores are different. . To archive that I&#39;m going to use two sample t-test. . tval,pval=stats.ttest_ind(df[df[&#39;address&#39;]==&#39;U&#39;][&#39;avg_score&#39;],df[df[&#39;address&#39;]==&#39;R&#39;][&#39;avg_score&#39;]) pval . 0.03304768998307145 . We reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level and conclude the mean score for students from Urban area and students from Rural area is different. . That shows that students from Rural areas are taking education more seriously because it could be a ticket to a better life. . Conclusion . The limitation of this data set is quite obvious. Mainly this dataset was dedicated to students, therefore there&#39;s not much data about parents. Although I&#39;ve only scratched the surface there&#39;s still a lot to explore, like relationship between going out and internet, study time and failures, etc. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
