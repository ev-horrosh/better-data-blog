            "title": "Risk Monitoring and Mitigation of the Urban Forest",
            "content": "Urban forest is more important than you think. . We all know some benefits of trees like cleaning the air from CO2 and aesthetic reasons. . But there are more to it than you think: . Carbon sequestration/storage | Promoting diverse flora | Barrier to noisy traffic | Each large front yard tree adds about 1% to sales price of the property | Trees reduce stormwater runoff by capturing and storing rainfall in their canopy and promote the infiltration of rainwater into the soil | . But what exactly goes into sustaining the life of the trees and what are the risks of not taking it seriously? Here&#39;s where urban forest monitoring, prevention and mitigation comes in. Increasing public safety and examining conditions of the trees non-destructively to develop a plan of action. preventing sidewalk damage. Monitoring invasive norway maple that lessen diversity of other trees and living habitat as well as Ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) in preparation for an invasion of emerald ash borer. budget allocation for renewal and pruning. . This project is going to aim to help to identify, predict possible risk and areas of attention. . For this project I&#39;ll be working with few datasets: . New-York tree inventory data taken from NYC Open Data. . The dataset is Urban street tree inventory data for Newburgh, New York in 2015. Urban street tree inventory data for Newburgh, New York in 2015 . Finally, Historic Tree Inventory - 2018/2019 within the City of Buffalo . Since NYC tree inventory has more features and observations It&#39;ll be the training dataset. The other two I&#39;ll test predictions on. . Feature Engineering . the data set doesn&#39;t have many useful of features to work with but there&#39;s some possibility for feature engineering. like to combine address and street name to find out longitude and latitude of trees using geopy for ploting them using plotly on the map. . we can use a formula to make predictions of the age according to the species to create even more features. . for visualization . make a year slider connected to a growing riskfactor areas with high tree pollen . uploading dataset set of a different city . With a high ephasis on urban forest it&#39;s important to it healthy and hazard free. . to find out which trees corresponds to what degree of allergy severity, I used this website. due to lack of time I have not scraped the data(which in the future I should), but I copied manually into spreadsheet. The plan is to merge dataframes on botanical name . After training a model to predict risk rating it would be possible to upload the data of tree inventory from another city(given its formatted accordingly) to see a forecast of the trees that need attention. . Data Wrangling . NYC tree inventory contains close to a million observations. This dataset is updated regularly. with this large dataset we wouldn worry about dropping missing values. Wrangling will be important for the dataset to contain necessary variables and be memory efficient. . df_ny_trees=pd.read_csv(&#39;Forestry_Tree_Points.csv&#39;) df_ny_trees.columns=df_ny_trees.columns.str.lower() df_ny_trees=df_ny_trees.drop([&#39;objectid&#39;,&#39;plantingspaceglobalid&#39;, &#39;geometry&#39;,&#39;globalid&#39;,&#39;riskratingdate&#39;, &#39;planteddate&#39;,&#39;createddate&#39;,&#39;updateddate&#39;,&#39;stumpdiameter&#39;],axis=1) df_ny_trees=df_ny_trees.dropna() df_ny_trees=df_ny_trees.rename(columns={&#39;genusspecies&#39;:&#39;botanical_name&#39;}) df_ny_trees[&#39;botanical_name&#39;]=df_ny_trees[&#39;botanical_name&#39;].str.lower() df_ny_trees[&#39;botanical_name&#39;]=df_ny_trees[&#39;botanical_name&#39;].str.split(&#39;-&#39;).str[0] df_ny_trees[&#39;tpcondition&#39;]=df_ny_trees[&#39;tpcondition&#39;].str.lower() df_ny_trees[&#39;tpstructure&#39;]=df_ny_trees[&#39;tpstructure&#39;].str.lower() df_ny_trees[&#39;dbh&#39;]=df_ny_trees[&#39;dbh&#39;].astype(int) df_ny_trees[&#39;riskrating&#39;]=df_ny_trees[&#39;riskrating&#39;].astype(int) df_ny_trees[&#39;botanical_name&#39;]=df_ny_trees[&#39;botanical_name&#39;].str.split(&#39;-&#39;).str[0] df_ny_trees.drop(df_ny_trees[df_ny_trees[&#39;tpcondition&#39;]==&#39;unknown&#39;].index, inplace=True) df_ny_trees[&#39;latitude&#39;]=(df_ny_trees[&#39;location&#39;] .apply(lambda x: x.split(&#39;(&#39;)[-1].strip(&#39;)&#39;).split(&#39;,&#39;)) .apply(lambda x:x[0])).astype(float) df_ny_trees[&#39;longitude&#39;]=(df_ny_trees[&#39;location&#39;] .apply(lambda x: x.split(&#39;(&#39;)[-1].strip(&#39;)&#39;).split(&#39;,&#39;)) .apply(lambda x:x[1])).astype(float) df_ny_trees=df_ny_trees.drop(&#39;location&#39;,axis=1) df_ny_trees.loc[df_ny_trees[&#39;botanical_name&#39;]==&quot;prunus serrulata &#39;green leaf&#39; &quot;,&#39;botanical_name&#39;]=&#39;prunus serrulata&#39; df_ny_trees[&#39;botanical_name&#39;]=df_ny_trees[&#39;botanical_name&#39;].str.extract(&#39;(^[,.

As we can see the most popular tree is Norway mapple. after some research it considers to be invasive. . Here are few concerns: . Norway maple (Acer platanoides) is a large deciduous tree that can grow up to approximately 40-60 feet in height. They are tolerant of many different growing environments and have been a popular tree to plant on lawns and along streets because of their hardiness. Norway maples have very shallow roots and produce a great deal of shade which makes it difficult for grass and other plants to grow in the understory below. In urban environments, the root systems also destroy pavement, requiring expensive repairs. Other species of flora and fauna, such as insects and birds, may indirectly be affected due to the change in resource diversity and availability. Additionally, they are prolific seed producers and are now invading forests and forest edges. . Collecting the data is the most time intensive task, since I&#39;m not a domain expert and have to learn fast and the fact of not having enough features. A lot of research had to be done-detective work. .

In this table we can see students&#39; average score of single and not single from Urban and Rural areas. It seems like students of single parents from Rural areas have better scores on average compared with Urban counterparts. But students whose parents live together in Urban area have better scores. . Visualization . fig,ax=plt.subplots(figsize=(16, 9)) ax.set_title(&quot;Student&#39;s score according to where they live&quot;, fontsize=18) ax.set_xlabel(&quot;Parents&quot;) ax.set_ylabel(&quot;avg student score&quot;) sns.barplot(data=stu) plt.show() . This bar plot illustrates that students of a single parent from Rural area have better average score than other categories. . Hypothesis Test . Null Hypothesis is that the average score of students who live in Urban and Rural areas are the same. . Alternative Hypothesis is that the average scores are different. . To archive that I&#39;m going to use two sample t-test. . tval,pval=stats.ttest_ind(df[df[&#39;address&#39;]==&#39;U&#39;][&#39;avg_score&#39;],df[df[&#39;address&#39;]==&#39;R&#39;][&#39;avg_score&#39;]) pval . 0.03304768998307145 . We reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level and conclude the mean score for students from Urban area and students from Rural area is different. . That shows that students from Rural areas who live with a single parent are taking education more seriously because it could be a ticket to a better life. On the other hand, surprisingly, students from Rural areas that live with both parents have low average scores. Probably because there is no incentive for them to get higher education. Life is set for them. . Conclusion . The limitation of this data set is quite obvious. Mainly this dataset was dedicated to students, therefore there&#39;s not much data about parents. Although I&#39;ve only scratched the surface there&#39;s still a lot to explore, like relationship between going out and internet, study time and failures or why students that live with both parents in Rural areas have a lower score. .",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
